## Authentication
To use guardicore CLI, a proper authentication needs to be provided.
Therefore please create an .edgerc file or extend an already existing akamai .edgerc file with the following contents.
The default search location for the edgerc file is `~/.edgerc`. 

Please make sure you enter the hostname **without** any scheme (http:// or https://)
```bash
[default]
gc_hostname = your_host_name.guardicore.com       # Do not prepend http(s)://
gc_username = your_api_username
gc_password = your_api_password
```

| CENTRA_MANAGEMENT_PORT | 443     | Alternative to EDGERC - put the CENTRA management port here |
| CENTRA_MANAGEMENT_USERNAME                | none    | Alternative to EDGERC - put the CENTRA username here |

## Self signed certificates
In order to work with self-signed certificates, you have 2 options:
- You skip the TLS certificate (this is very insecure)
  Either use the `--skip-tls-validation` flag on the command line or
  set the following ENV variable on your system
  ```bash
  export GC_SKIP_TLS_VALIDATION=True
  ```
 
- You provide the root CA of your self signed certifcate to the python process 
  ```bash
  export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/path/to/your/certificate.pem
  ```
